# UPI-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This is my final year project where I built a machine learning model to detect UPI (Unified Payments Interface) fraud. The goal is to classify whether a transaction is **fraudulent or genuine** based on features from transaction data.

## üß† Project Highlights

- Used a **custom dataset** with features like transaction type, amount, sender/receiver info, etc.
- Preprocessing includes **handling missing values**, **encoding categorical variables**, and **feature scaling**.
- Applied multiple ML algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.
- Deployed model locally using **Flask** (optional: add if you did this).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask (if used)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the notebook
jupyter notebook

If deployed using Flask:
cd app
python app.py
